## Links
The codes are taken from

## Others
**What is Coredata.txt?**

Based on my knowledge, Coredata.txt usually used by most (Maybe all) Private Server coders as a data to define items' tribute

**The properties/categories of this item doesn't seem to be right!**

Please note that I won't be responsible for any errors. If you're facing a problem with properties and/or categories, you can check
**[GrowtopiaNoobs' Items.dat Decoder](https://github.com/GrowtopiaNoobs/Growtopia_ItemsDecoder)**.
The way is by testing the items. You can simply see the items properties and categories in the `ActionType` and `ItemCategory` objects.
Easier way to do this is still not found for me. If you're still insist, you can ask me or another person that's better than me instead.
